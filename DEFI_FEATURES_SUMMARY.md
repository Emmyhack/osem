  // Yield Optimization
  yieldEarned: number           // Total yield earned by group
  yieldAPY: number             // Current Annual Percentage Yield
  totalYieldGenerated: number   // Cumulative yield across all time
  idleFundsInvested: number    // Amount currently generating yield
  
  // Insurance Coverage
  insuranceCoverage: number     // Coverage percentage (90-98%)
  insuranceContribution: number // Monthly insurance contribution
  riskLevel: 'Low' | 'Medium' | 'High' // Risk assessment
}
```
